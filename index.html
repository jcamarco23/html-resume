       <H2>Summary</H2>
       <P>I have spent my career in the medical field helping others heal. In that time I have always found myself yearning for creativity.
        I have found that creativity in all different ways. I have dabbled in music, drawing, painting, digitial art, and more. I enjoy the challenge of learning something new. My most recent interest has brought me here, to web development and coding. </P>
